Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems.
Project Overview
The Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems dynamically adjusts task priorities to optimize performance based on workload and deadlines. It provides an interactive simulation of real-time scheduling algorithms, ensuring efficient task execution.

ðŸŒŸ Features
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Priorities â€“ Automatically adjusts task priorities based on system workload.
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Scheduling â€“ Schedules tasks with strict deadlines and real-time constraints.
ðŸ”¹ Workload Adaptation â€“ Adjusts dynamically for enhanced system efficiency.
ðŸ”¹ User-Friendly Interface â€“ Clean UI built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ§® Implemented Scheduling Algorithms
ðŸ“Œ Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)
Assigns higher priority to tasks with shorter periods.

Best for fixed, periodic tasks where deadlines are predictable.

Ensures deadline guarantees if CPU utilization conditions are met.

ðŸ“Œ Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
Prioritizes tasks with the earliest deadlines.

Works well for dynamic workloads with varying deadlines.

More flexible than RMS but requires efficient scheduling overhead.
